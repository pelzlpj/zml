* Closure conversion.

* Parser rewrite.  I'm not liking the way the ocamlyacc parser is shaping up.  It's difficult to
  read, and I'm not sure it will scale up well to more complicated syntax.  I plan to rewrite using
	a recursive descent approach.  I want to do this rewrite *before* adding significant amounts of
	new syntax.

* Introduction of reference types.  The runtime library already has reference type support, but the
	zasm layer needs a bunch of work to invoke zml_register_root and zml_unregister_root in order to
	manage the lifetimes of reference types declared on the stack.
